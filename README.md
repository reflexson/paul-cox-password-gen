# paul-cox-password-gen

## Description

This project is a website application to generate a random password. Once the "Generate Password" button is pressed, a series of prompts start to determine the length and character set of the password.  If the user inputs a value into the prompt that does not match the criteria of the answer, another prompt will instruct the user to use a correct response format. 

Once the prompts are finished, a password will appear in the password area.  The "Copy Password" button can then be pressed to copy the text in the password field to the clipboard. 


This project helped me solidify Javascript concepts that we have covered in class.  Setting variables, generating functions, and adding event listeners are a few of the concepts incorporated into this project. 
I also learned a lot about how to properly organize a webpage so that other developers and users can easily view, navigate, add to, or edit this site. I also was able to learn and practice git procedures for pushing, pulling, branching, adding files, committing, creating pull requests, and merging branches through github.
